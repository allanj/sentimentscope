sentimentscope_nonlatent_english
sentimentscope_semimarkov_nonlatent_english

After executing one command, the program will create a unique folder for storing experiment results. You can type "make check" to see the progress logs and evaluation results in the end. The experiment results store in experiments/sentiment/model/<modelname>/<lang>.

Notice that pipeline will involve two steps of training and evaluation automatically.
