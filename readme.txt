The guide to run Sentiment Span experiments

1. Run "make init" to initialize files and folders
2. Run "make <experiment>" for experiments

sentimentspan_latent_wordembedding_english
sentimentspan_nonlatent_english
sentimentspan_semimarkov_nonlatent_english
sentimentspan_semimarkov_latent_english

After executing a command, the program will create a unique folder for storing experiment results. You can type "make check" to show the folder. The experiment results store in experiments/sentiment/model/<modelname>/<lang>.

Notice that pipeline will involve two steps of training and evaluation automatically.

3. Run "make eval" to evaluate the results and obtain the statistics for current experiment. In addition, statistics will be stored in the folder mentioned above.
